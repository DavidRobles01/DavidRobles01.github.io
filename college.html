                    A possible Major that this university offers that interests 
                    me is Computer Science. My interest for computer science 
                    started in 9th grades because I was and am in the computer 
                    science pathway. It is interesting because it like the idea 
                    the a whole lot of words numbers and letters can end up 
                    being a really cool product. The required SAT score for this
                    university is 1390 and my PSAT score was 930. This means 
                    that my SAT score is not high enough for this university but
                    this is just the practice test so this means that my score 
                    can better and that I can reach the minimum score needed. 
                    The average GPA for Stanford is a 4.18 and currently I have 
                    a 4.2 so I am on track with my GPA section I just need to 
                    stay on top of my things.

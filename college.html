                    A possible major the this university offers the interests me
                    is Bioengineering. This major interests me because 
                    engineering has always been a topic that has caught my 
                    attention. Also because just knowing that using biology, 
                    which was one of my favorite topics in school, to engineer 
                    products that people can use in their daily lives sounds 
                    amazing to me. The required SAT score for this university is
                    1390 and my PSAT score was 930. This means that my SAT score
                    is not high enough for this university but this is just the 
                    practice test so this means that my score can better and 
                    that I can reach the minimum score needed. The average GPA 
                    for Stanford is a 4.18 and currently I have a 4.2 so I am on
                    track with my GPA section I just need to stay on top of my 
                    things.

                <p>
                The computing innovation I picked is Tesla model x. The purpose of Tesla model x is to
                be a family car without compromise. It is also a self driving car that uses the energy that tesla
                has made. The car works by using lithium ion batteries to power it up.(4) The artifact shows that
                tesla model x uses batteries to power it up and that it uses cameras for better safety.
                </p>

                <p>
                I created this artifact by putting images together that represent Tesla model x. The
                program I used to create this artifact is called gimp. First, I went on google and searched for
                images that showed what Tesla model x has. Second, I downloaded the images onto the
                computer. Third, I made a new file one gimp and titled it. Fourth I uploaded the images into the
                file and started to organize the images. Fifth, in big letters I typed Tesla model x at the top of my
                file. Finally, I typed an explanation of Tesla model x in smaller size font.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Response 2c:</h4>
                <p>
                One beneficial effect that tesla has is that it's car model x, an all electric car, is the
                safest, fastest and most capable sport utility vehicle.(1) This means that it can help you get to
                places faster and safer. But tesla model x also has harmful effects. For example the car itself is
                not creating pollution but the process to make the car makes a lot of pollution. A lot of the
                metals needed to make an electric car come from environmentally destructive mines.(3) This
                means that you, the owner of the tesla car, might not be physically polluting but what you
                bought has caused a lot of pollution already. An impact that tesla model has is that it is the
                safest and fastest vehicle. This can affect the society because if a lot more people own a tesla
                car, safety would not be much of an issue anymore, so you won't have to worry about getting in
                a car accident.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Response 2d:</h4>
                <p>
                Tesla wants to use cameras on their cars to collect data on lane lines, street signs, and
                traffic light positions.(2) This data will then be processed into information that can help tesla's
                cars better identify the lane lines, street signs, and traffic light positions. This can lead to a data
                privacy concern because of the recordings. Since it is recording all of your surroundings tesla
                will be able to know your location, where you live, where you work, and etc, whereas in cars
                without cameras the only thing they did was drive so there was no way of knowing your location.

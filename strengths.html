                <h3 class="center"><u>Future Thinker:</u></h3>
                <p class="ft" class="center">Most of my time is spent thinking 
                about what the future could be. I tend to space out a lot b
                ecause i'm thinking about what could happen if certain actions 
                are made. This then leads to me thinking of what I can do and 
                what I can't do yet. The yet is very important because I don't 
                like to think of things as impossible because no matter how good
                or bad you are at something there is always room for 
                improvement, so if enough effort and time is put into something 
                you will be able to accomplish what you want to accomplish and 
                this goes for anyone not just me.</p>
                <p class="ft" class="center">I use this strength in everything 
                but mainly in school. For example if I see there is something 
                that interests me during class I would space out during class 
                and just think about the topic that has been said. Also because 
                I know i'm not the best in all the classes I like to think 
                about how things would be if I was the best in some of the 
                classes. Also when there is class discussion I tend to think 
                deep about the topic and sometimes not participate because I am 
                busy thinking about everything.</p>
                <p class="ft" class="center">The way I feel depends on what I am thinking about because 
                sometimes I think about really sad things and it just makes me feel 
                depressed and other times I could be thinking about great things and 
                that makes me feel happy. Also sometimes when I think about school or 
                life I feel stressed.</p>

                <br/>
                How can I use this strength:
                <ul>
                    <li>Create new plans</li>
                    <li>Making people believe in themself</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="center"><u>Competing:</u></h3>
                <p class="cp" class="center">I am enjoy competing and love the feeling of winning. I think 
                of a lot of things in life as a game and a hate losing. It is like this
                everyday no matter what I will compete against someone or something. I 
                will compete against you even if you don't know i'm competing against 
                you. If there is no one to compete against I go against myself, I try to 
                do things faster or better than the first time. Even if the competition 
                is something very important to you I will still want to and will try to 
                be number one.</p>
                <p class="cp" class="center">I use this strength in everything, 
                like the description says I see everything in life as a game. 
                For example when it comes to academics I always want to be the 
                best and when I finally get better than someone in my head I 
                think to myself "yes I have beat you" but I don't tell the 
                person that because it would be really weird because it was not 
                an actual competition. Also when me and my friends are doing 
                something most of the time I try to one up them.</p>

                <br/>
                How can I use this strength:
                <ul>
                    <li>Never settling for less</li>
                    <li>Always trying to succeed in life</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="center"><u>Discoverer:</u></h3>
                <p class="dc" class="center">Exploration is another thing that I like doing. Not only 
                exploring physical places or things but exploring ideas. I like to ask a 
                lot of questions like why and how. I want to find out how an idea came to
                be and who had the idea. I find talking with people that are creative 
                because it can spark more new ideas. I also find boring doing things the 
                same way everyone else does because I like to find new ways do 
                everything. This shows the amount of creativity that I have and it also 
                shows that there can be an infinite amount of ways to do one thing.</p>
                <p class="dc" class="center">I use this strength in my daily 
                life when philosophical conversations come up with my friends. 
                Most of the time I am the one that starts the conversation. I 
                also like speaking with the other smart people in all my classes
                because if there is something I don't understand for some reason
                just speaking with them sparks an idea and makes me understand 
                the topic.</p>

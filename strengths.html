                <h3 class="center"><u>Future Thinker:</u></h3>
                <p class="ft" class="center">Most of my time is spent thinking about what the future could 
                be. I tend to space out a lot because i'm thinking about we could happen 
                if certain actions are made. This then leads to me thinking of what I can
                do and what I can't do yet. The yet is very important because I don't 
                like think of things as impossible because no matter how good or bad you 
                are at something there is always room for improvement, so if enough 
                effort and time is put into something you will be able to accomplish what
                you want to accomplish and this goes for anyone not just me.</p>
                <p class="ft" class="center">I use this strength in everything but mainly in school. For
                example if I see there is something that interests me during class I 
                would space out during class and just think about the topic that has been
                said. Also because I know i'm not the best in all the classes so I like 
                to think about how things would be if I was the best in some of the 
                classes. Also when there is class discussion I tend to think deep about 
                the topic and sometimes not participat because I am busy thinking about 
                everything.</p>
                <p class="ft" class="center">The way I feel depends on what I am thinking about because 
                sometimes I think about realy sad things and it just makes me feel 
                depressed and othere times I could be thinking about great things and 
                that makes me feel happy. Also some times when I think about school or 
                life I feel stressed.</p>

                <br/>
                How can I use this strength:
                <ul>
                    <li>Create new plans</li>
                    <li>Making people believe in themself</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="center"><u>Competing:</u></h3>
                <p class="cp" class="center">I am enjoy competing and love the feeling of winning. I think 
                of a lot of things in life as a game and a hate losing. It is like 
                everyday no matter what I will compete against someone or something. I 
                will compete against you even if you don't know i'm competing against 
                you. If there is no one to compete against I go against myself, I try to 
                do things faster or better than the first time. Even if the competition 
                is something very important to you I will still want to and will try to 
                be number one.</p>
                <p class="cp" class="center">I use this strenght in everything, like the description 
                says I see everything is life as a game</p>

                <ul>

                    <li>Always trying to succeed in life</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="center"><u>Discoverer:</u></h3>
                <p class="dc" class="center">Exploration is another thing that I like doing. Not only 
                exploring physical places or things but exploring ideas. I like to ask a 
                lot of questions like why and how. I want to find out how an idea came to
                be and who had the idea. I find talking with people that are creative 
                because it can spark more new ideas. I also find boring doing things the 
                same way everyone else does because I like to find new ways do 
                everything. This shows the amount of creativity that I have and it also 
                shows that there can be an infinite amount of ways to do one thing.</p>
